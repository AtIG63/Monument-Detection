# Monument-Detection
# Heritage Identification of Monuments using Deep Learning Techniques

## Project Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to identify and provide information about historical monuments through images. It bridges the gap between technological advancements and heritage preservation, enhancing public awareness and engagement.

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Enables users to upload images for monument identification.
- **Information Retrieval**: Delivers detailed information on identified monuments.
- **Open-Source Database**: Supports the expansion of monument data through user contributions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Facilitates easy interaction for all users.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask (backend)
- React (frontend)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/Monument-Detection/Monument-Detection.git


2. Install the required packages:

  pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Flask server:

  python server.py

4. Launch the React frontend:

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

## Usage
- Visit the hosted URL or run locally on localhost.
- Upload a monument image using the interface.
- Receive information about the monument identified by the system.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to expand the database and enhance the app. Please adhere to the standard fork-clone-Pull Request workflow.
